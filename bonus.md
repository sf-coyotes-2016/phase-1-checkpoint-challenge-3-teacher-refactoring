# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
    .fetch allows you to set a default value to a hash

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
    Single inheritance only allows a class to inherit from a single class. A class can however accept any number of modules

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
    This allows the values to be accessed by key rather than by the order of the arguments

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

    private keeps data from being accessed outside of the class
    
5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
