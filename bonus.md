# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
When we pass in args if some there is no value provided for some specific instance variable we can set the and fetch the default value with it. 

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance as opposed to multiple inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

So it give the programmer more flexibility from user prospective. If some values are missing program will still work and can also set to have default values. It also helps to pass lots of arguments at once and still maintains readable code.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

private keyword makes the methods private and are only accessible inside the class. It also gives your team heads up that not to make these methods public if you are working with other or future programmers.

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
