# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?

2. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

3. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

4. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?

5. Consider the following scenario.  You are modelling animals, and you want to be able to model mammals such as cats and dogs, and bats, and birds such as parrots and pigeons.  One approach to this would be to have a Mammal class and a FlyingAnimal class which both inherit from Animal, then have your Bat class inherit from both Mammal and FlyingAnimal.  However, in ruby, we can only inherit from a single superclass.  What design pattern would we use instead?  Outline your design (no need for actual code).
